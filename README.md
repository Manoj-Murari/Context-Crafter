#  Context Crafter - A Web Extension

Turn your entire codebase into a perfectly formatted prompt for any LLM, right from your browser.

In the age of AI, your codebase is a conversation. Context Crafter is the ultimate universal translator, letting you brief your AI assistant on a complete project without the hassle of manual file handling or context limits.

## ‚ú® What It Does

Manually copying and pasting files into an AI prompt is slow, inefficient, and quickly hits token limits. Context Crafter solves this by intelligently reading your project, filtering out the noise, and packaging everything into a single, focused brief for your AI.

It runs as a Chrome Extension in your browser's side panel, integrating seamlessly into your workflow.
