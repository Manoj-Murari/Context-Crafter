# 🪄 Context Crafter

**In the age of AI, your codebase is a conversation.  
This is the ultimate universal translator.**

## ✨ Stop Copying Files. Start Crafting Context.
Manually copying files into an AI prompt breaks your flow, makes you lose track of your goal, and quickly hits context limits.  
The conversation with your AI becomes a series of frustrating fragments.  

**Context Crafter** transforms this broken dialogue into a seamless, intelligent partnership.  
It is not just a utility—it’s a new workflow for software development in the age of AI.  

It reads the soul of your repository, filters out the noise, and presents a single, perfect brief for your AI counterpart.

## 🧪 The Alchemy: What Makes It Magical

- 🌐 **Universal Ingestion**  
  Process any public GitHub repository from the live web app, or use the offline desktop version to process local folders with a path paste or drag-and-drop.

- 🤖 **The Arbiter Engine**  
  Smart Mode understands project structures and instantly dismisses the noise—`node_modules`, `.git`, build artifacts, and caches—ensuring only the most relevant code is included.

- ⚙️ **The Sculptor's Tools**  
  Fine-tune the context with custom ignore patterns (`docs/`, `*.test.js`, etc.), sculpting the perfect input for your AI.

- 🧩 **The Scribe's Scroll**  
  For vast codebases, Context Crafter splits content into numbered scrolls with a guided workflow, ensuring every line of your saga is captured, perfectly and in order.

- 💎 **The Obsidian UI**  
  A sleek, glassmorphism interface—fluid, responsive, and designed to feel like an extension of your mind.
